This blog is mainly about agile software development techniques. The examples are mostly Java but there are posts that focus on the language I'm learning this year as part of my Pragmatic Programmer
"learn a new language every year" habit. That means Kotlin, JavaScript, Go, Scala, Python, and Rust, among others.

This blog was generated with Jekyll and currently uses the _Cayman Blog_ Jekyll theme.
