# About me 

I am a Filipino-American living in Columbus, Ohio. My family and I came to the US in 1997 on a wave of Y2K hirings. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology in Iligan City, Philippines. However, my entire professional life has been in software development. I am passionate about quality software and enjoy learning new things.

I have also held positions as a technical lead, coach, and facilitator. I have worked for several consulting companies in these various roles and I try to remain active in the developer community by writing, giving talks, and occasionally speaking at conferences.

My experience is mainly in Java but I have come to really enjoy working with Kotlin. I think Kotlin is a great language and I hope to use it more in the future.
