# About me 

My name is Junilu Lacar and I have been a software developer since the late 80s. I am currently semi-retired (since August 2025). I'm trying this out for a while, doing some traveling around the world with my wife and, hopefully, some occasional blogging. In a year or so I'll see if I want to stay retired or get back in the game for a few more years.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology in Iligan City, Philippines. My entire professional life, however, has been in software development. I am passionate about simplicity, value, and software quality and enjoy learning new things and helping others learn.

I have also held positions as a technical lead, coach, and facilitator. I have worked for a number of companies including Cisco, Accenture, and JPMorganChase. I try to stay active in the developer community by writing, giving talks, and occasionally speaking at conferences.

My experience is mainly in Java but I have come to really enjoy working with Kotlin. I think Kotlin is a great language and I hope to use it more in the future.
