## About me, Junilu Lacar

I have over thirty years of experience in software development. I'm currently an Agile Technical Coach 
with Accenture|SolutionsIQ where my official title is "Business Agility Enablement Manager" even though nobody 
actually reports to me. My main responsibilities are to coach client teams on agile technical practices like 
TDD/BDD, refactoring, automated testing, pair/mob/ensemble programming. I've been co-facilitating six-week dojos 
recently and having a lot of fun doing it. 

I'm most comfortable programming in Java but also know other languages like JavaScript, C#, Kotlin, Go, Python, Pascal, 
Groovy, Scala, and various dialects of SQL. I'm also familiar with Domain-Driven Design, design principles and 
patterns in general, functional programming, and object-oriented programming. 

I've used Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle, git, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEs like IDEA and WebStorm, and a 
myriad of other tools I won't bore you with. 

I'm a long-time developer and student of agile software development methods. I am constantly looking for ways to get
better as a developer, as a coach, as a person. I hope you'll find something useful here. 

Thanks for visiting!
