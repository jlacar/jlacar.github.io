## About me

I'm a long-time developer and student of agile software development methods. I am constantly looking for ways to get
better as a developer, as a coach, as a person. I focus more on agile technical practices like emergent design,
BDD/TDD, refactoring, automated testing, and pair/mob/ensemble programming.

## About this blog

Information about different approaches for learning and improving. 

A recurring theme will be about techniques for learning and practicing skills in a deliberate, systematic, and 
disciplined way to maximize retention, accelerate mastery, and minimize churn. Also, stuff about agile software 
development. A smattering of things related to martial arts like Aikido, Wing Chun, and Jiujitsu.
