## About this blog

This blog is where I'll try to reflect on different approach to learning about the things that interest me. 

A recurring theme will be how to learn and practice techniques and acquire new skills in a deliberate,  
systematic, and disciplined way to maximize retention, accelerate mastery, and minimize churn.

## About me

I'm a long-time developer and student of agile software development methods. I am constantly looking for ways to get 
better as a developer, as a coach, as a person. I focus more on agile technical practices like emergent design, 
BDD/TDD, refactoring, automated testing, and pair/mob/ensemble programming.
