## About this blog

I started this blog as a way to capture and reflect on my approach to learning about various things that 
interest me. A recurring theme will be how to learn and practice techniques and acquire new skills in a deliberate, 
systematic, and disciplined way to maximize retention and accelerate mastery, and minimize churn.

## About me

I'm a long-time developer and student of agile methods. I am constantly looking for ways to get better as a developer
and coach with a strong focus on agile technical practices like emergent design, BDD/TDD, refactoring, automated 
testing, and pair/mob programming.
