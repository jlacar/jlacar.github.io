## About this blog

The articles in this blog focus mainly on techniques that I think help enhance technical agility. These include things
like Test-Driven Development (TDD), refactoring, and pair/mob/ensemble programming. Occasionally, I will write about how
programming relates to other things I do, like Aikido or solving a Rubik's cube.

I am most comfortable programming in Java so that's what you'll see in most of my code examples. However, I also
subscribe to the Pragmatic Programmers' practice of learning a new programming language every year so you'll also see me
use whatever new language I'm learning at any particular moment. So far, I have learned Python, Go, Groovy, Kotlin, and
Scala. Rust and Haskell are still in the queue.

A recurring theme in the articles is deliberate learning and practice. Deliberate and mindful practice, in my opinion,
helps instill discipline, maximizes retention, accelerates mastery, and minimizes churn. I also write about agility but
not so much about Agility and the AIC (Agile Industrial Complex). In other words, this is my safe, not SAFe, place.
