# Unconscious Tech Debt isn't really a thing

> _You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear_—Sammy Davis, Jr.

A common view of Technical Debt is that it's something that happens unconsciously or incidentally. Here's one such 
definition of Technical Debt I saw recently:

> Technical Debt is the deferment of good software design for the sake of expediency. Put simply, we’ve chosen to 
> make some questionable design choices in order to get product delivered. This may be a conscious choice, but—more 
> often than not—it’s unconscious, and the result of a time-crunch. (Myers, 2021)

I don't buy the unconscious part of that.

If you claim your actions were unconscious, then you can't claim they were the result of an external influence like 
a time-crunch. If that were true, it means you _were_ aware of the time pressure and acknowledge that you were 
acting accordingly. Consciousness is, by definition, being aware, so that rationale doesn't really make sense. 

If we're really being honest, that wasn't an unconscious choice. Rather, you made a conscious choice to acquiesce to 
an immediate demand and avoid the consequences, whether perceived or real, of not declaring "Done!" at a 
predetermined—and usually arbitrary—point in time rather than risk dealing with the pain caused by moving forward 
with not-quite-right software.   

The consequences of not meeting a deadline are far more immediate and palpable, so dealing with that threat becomes 
more urgent. On the other hand, the consequences of adding to an existing technical debt load are not a clear and 
present danger so don't feel as much urgency to face them, if at all.

It really boils down to choosing to dodge a real arrow now or dodging a theoretical bullet tomorrow. 
You can't fault anyone for choosing to dodge the arrow; it's perfectly normal and understandable human nature.

So, rather than Unconscious Debt, maybe it's more correct to call it Instinctive Debt. That is, it's debt 
that comes from choices we made to satisfy our primitive needs, like fear and avoiding danger. We are simply doing 
what our primitive Lizard Brain tells us to do in these kinds of situations.

Not a fan of Instinctive Debt? How about Primitive Debt? Lizard Brain Debt? I don't know, but it seems disingenuous 
to call it unconscious, unintentional, or accidental debt.

## Overruling our Lizard Brain

There are two keys to freeing ourselves from the clutches of our Lizard Brain.

The first key is reason. This is the easy part. In most instances, it's far more costly in the long run to keep 
carrying technical debt forward and continue to pay the interest of the extra time and effort needed to work with 
not-quite-right software. If we can make the difference in that tradeoff abundantly clear, then we can reason that 
it's far wiser and cheaper and therefore, more beneficial to make that stitch in time to save nine.

The second key, courage, is a little trickier. For this, we need to go back to the Lizard Brain and appeal to its 
better side, the side opposite of fear. This is where we can get into a Catch-22 situation. We need to refactor 
because there's too much technical debt, but we can't refactor because there's too much technical debt.

The answer to this problem is patience, practice, and perseverance.
