This blog is mostly about software development in general and specifically about agile software development, with a strong slant toward the technical side of things. It also has articles about mindfulness and deliberate practice and things I think many software developers unfortunately don't do often enough around design, quality, and the impact their work has on others and the world.

Most of the code examples you'll find here will be in Kotlin, Java, or JavaScript since these are what I program in most of the time. You may find some occasional posts with examples in other languages I dabble in like Python, Go, and Rust.
