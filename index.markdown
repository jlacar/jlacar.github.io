Hello! My name is Junilu Lacar and I have been a software developer since the late 80s. I am currently semi-retired (since August 2025), meaning I'm trying this out while doing some traveling around the world with my wife and, hopefully, occasional blogging. The plan is to do this for a year or so then see if I want to continue sitting it out on the sidelines or get back in the game for a few more years.

This blog is mostly about software development in general and specifically about agile software development, with a strong leaning toward the technical side of things. I'll also write about being mindful and deliberate about the things we do as software developers, thinking carefully about design, quality, and the impact with have on others and the world.

Most of the code examples you'll find here will be in either Kotlin, Java, or JavaScript since these are what I program in most of the time. You may find some occasional posts with examples in other languages I dabble in like Python, Go, and Rust.
