This blog is about software development in general and specifically about agile software development with a strong slant for the technical side of things. 
It's also about being deliberate about the things we do as developers, being mindful about design, quality, and the value we're delivering to the people 
whose lives we hope to help improve with our software. 

Most of the code examples you'll find here will be in either Java, Kotlin, or JavaScript since these are what I program in most of the time. You will see
some occasional articles with examples in other languages like Go and Rust, because I also dabble in those once in a while.
