Albert Einstein called it "[spooky action at a distance](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spooky_action_at_a_distance)" or in German, [_spukhafte Fernwirkung_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spukhafte_Fernwirkung#German).

Google translate says _seltsam zufällige Fernverbindungen_ is German for "strangely coincidental long-distance connections"


I don't know what it is, but the online universe has been kind of freaky again lately. I think I've mentioned this a few times in the past but there are times when I feel like something or someone out there is trying to tell me something. I could chalk it up to strange coincidence if it were just the one time but it has happened quite a few times this past couple of weeks, way too many times, I think, for it to be mere coincidence. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just losing my marbles and becoming more delusional as I inch closer to six decades in this place.

## What's the Buzz?

The buzz it seems, at least within my social media circles, has mostly been about TDD and refactoring, topics that have been weighing heavy on my mind lately. These darn algorithms that drive social media can't be that good, can they?

Tim Ottinger and others folks at Industrial Logic, Javier Lopez at ThoughtWorks, Dave Farley at Continuous Delivery, Dave's content manager, Bernard McCarty, Doc Norton, Andrea L., et. al., ...just a ton of people. It seems a lot of people I know or follow online are talking about [refactoring](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7125483984209248256?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7125483984209248256%29), or [refactoring but not really refactoring](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/docondev_refactoryou-keep-using-that-word-activity-7145856724313260032-_2jd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) or TDD, or reasons for not doing TDD, or [how to get people to started on TDD](https://youtu.be/9rOgi8HbrcI?si=5BPvd3EfVmxZ25lS), TDD not taking over the world, refactoring, refactoring, refactoring. 

I mean, even as I was writing this, I just happened to stumble upon this [funny post about double negatives](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7145810261826818049?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and just [had to comment](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:groupPost:121615-7145674913280843777?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28groupPost%3A121615-7145674913280843777%2C7146062394220290048%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287146062394220290048%2Curn%3Ali%3AgroupPost%3A121615-7145674913280843777%29) on it. Anybody who thinks the universe doesn't have a sense of humor has never browsed their LinkedIn feed.




What's something a lot of people talk about doing all the time but hardly anybody actual does?

No, I'm not talking about sex. Sure, it fits the category but I think it comes in a distant second to refactoring. A very long distant second. I'd bet good money on it, even if we were at an Agile conference.


of people don't do, there sure are a lot of people talking about it.



Ok, it's gotta be the algorithms, right? Or maybe I should get more regular sleep and stop staying up so late writing blog posts.




When in doubt, translate it to German: seltsam zufällige Fernverbindungen - strangely random long-distance connections. Also, strangely coincidental long-distance connections

Doc Norton's recent LinkedIn post about the misuse and abuse of the term "refactoring" flew under the banner of a Princess Bride meme, quoting Inigo Montoya's famous quip "You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means." in reference to ? constant use of "Inconceivable!" 

Lots of talk about TDD
