_Junilu Lacar spends most of his time learning, practicing, and evangelizing Agile technical practices like TDD, BDD,
refactoring, automated testing, pair/mob/ensemble programming. Occasionally, he'll pause to ruminate while 
absentmindedly solving a Rubik's cube, which he can normally do in under a minute. If the weather is nice out, he'll 
hop on his unicycle and take it for a spin around the block._
